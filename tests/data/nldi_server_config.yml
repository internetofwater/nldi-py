    description: |
      The NLDI is a search service that takes a watershed outlet identifier as a starting point,
      a navigation mode to perform, and the type of data desired in response to the request. It
      can provide geospatial representations of the navigation or linked data sources found along
      the navigation. It also has the ability to return catchment the watershed outlet is
      contained in or the total upstream basin.
