# Network Linked Data Index Contribution Guidelines

First, Thank you for considering a contribution. This project is a community resource, its success is contingent on your contributions.

## Linked Data Contribution

Linked data contributions are made through a configuration of the [NLDI Crawler](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-crawler#contributing) in the [NLDI Database](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-db/blob/master/liquibase/changeLogs/nldi/nldi_data/update_crawler_source/crawler_source.tsv).

For support in this process, open [an issue in the NLDI-Services](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-services/issues) repository.

## Code Contribution

Contribution to the overall project are more than welcome. Please open an issue describing the goal of your contribution in the [NLDI-Services](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-services/issues) repository prior to opening a pull request. 

Contributions may ultimately reside in the services, database, or crawler repositories. All pull requests should link back to the issues in the services repository to ensure we track contributions in a single location.
