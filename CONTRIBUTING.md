# Network Linked Data Index Contribution Guidelines

First, Thank you for considering a contribution. This project is
a community resource, its success is contingent on your contributions.

## Linked Data Contribution

Linked data contributions are made through a configuration of the
[NLDI Crawler](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-crawler#contributing) in the
[NLDI Database](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-db/blob/master/liquibase/changeLogs/nldi/nldi_data/update_crawler_source/crawler_source.tsv).

For support in this process, open
[an issue in the NLDI-Services](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-services/issues) repository.

repositories. All pull requests should link back to the issues in the
services repository to ensure we track contributions in a single location.
