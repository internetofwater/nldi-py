Flowline
    A mapped stream segment or a path through a waterbody in the surface water network of the NHD. This
    is the basic unit of the NHD linear surface-water network.  See https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1096/ofr20191096.pdf

Basin
    This is how we are using 'basin' in the API...

Catchment
    A catchment is the land surface area flowing directly into an NHDPlus feature. For most networked
    surface-water linear features, the catchment represents the incremental area that drains directly to
    each feature or stream segment. See https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1096/ofr20191096.pdf

Hydrolocation
    This is how we are using hydrolocation....

Navigation

NHD
    National Hydrography Dataset.  See https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography
